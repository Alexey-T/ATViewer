<h2>TIFF support</h2>
<hr>
<p>
To support multi-paged TIFF files loading, you must have VTiff.dll file in the application EXE's folder.

<p>
Note about multi-paged files: arrows which change current TIFF page are located
in the top-right control's corner. Arrows may be not visible because of trial red message line.
In the full OCX version they are always visible.

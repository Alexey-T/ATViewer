<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td style="width: 40%;"><font color="DarkBlue">WebOffline</font></td>
  <td>Sets the "Offline connection" mode before a browser navigation operation.<br>
    Notes:<br>
    <ul>
    <li> This property is available only when "OFFLINE" define is uncommented in ATViewerOptions.inc.
         When the property is used, the "wininet.dll" is linked to the application at runtime.
    <li> This will toggle the <u>global</u> MSIE Offline flag
         (not TWebBrowser.Offline, since it doesn't work).
    <li> You don't need to read the global Offline flag at application startup and then restore it on exit.
         The component performs this task by itself.
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><font color="DarkBlue">WebBusy</font> (public, read-only)</td>
  <td>Returns the busy state of browser object.<br>
    You must check this value in your form's
    OnCloseQuery event handler like this:
   <pre>
   procedure TForm1.FormCloseQuery(Sender: TObject; var CanClose: Boolean);
   begin
     CanClose := not ATViewer1.WebBusy;
   end;</pre>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><font color="DarkBlue">WebAcceptAllFiles</font></td>
  <td>Enables the "File Download" browser dialog when attempt to open an unknown file type is performed in Internet mode.<br>
    Note:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>When "IE4X" conditional define is commented in ATViewerOptions.inc, this property is not used.
        When "IE4X" define is uncommented, this property is used and is False by default so
        no "File Download" dialogs appear.
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><font color="DarkBlue">WebWaitForNavigate</font></td>
  <td>Enables the waiting for browser navigation completion.<br>
    Note:<br>
    <ul>
    <li> Default is False: usually this is not needed and also not recommended
         (because the time for navigation completion may be significant and this will look like
         the application is "frozen"). But sometimes it may be useful: for
         example, if you want to scroll the control (using PosPercent property)
         immediately after page opening.
    </ul>

<h2>ATBinHex Component</h2>
<hr>

<b>ATBinHex</b> is a control that implements the quick file (stream) viewer.
Only visible part of file (or stream) is loaded into viewer, so it's suitable
to show files of unlimited size. Features:

<ul>
<li> Support for huge file sizes (of type Int64)
<li> Support for Unicode file names
<li> Support for multiple codepages: ANSI, OEM, EBCDIC, KOI8, ISO, Mac etc.
<li> Many service methods implemented: copying to Clipboard, printing, search etc.
</ul>

<p>
There are 5 view modes available:
<ul>
<li> <b>Text</b>: file is shown in text form
<li> <b>Binary</b>: file is shown in binary form, with fixed line length
<li> <b>Hex</b>: file is shown in hex dump
<li> <b>Unicode</b>: Unicode contents of file is shown
<li> <b>Unicode/Hex</b>: combined Hex and Unicode modes
</ul>

<p>
There is extended version of this component available,
<a href="http://www.uvviewsoft.com/delphi/atviewer.htm" target="_blank"><b>ATViewer</b></a>,
which can show files in such modes as RTF, Image, Multimedia, Internet and WLX Plugins.
But if you just need to show a plain file dump, <b>ATBinHex</b> should be enough.

<p>
There is also <b>FreePascal/Lazarus</b> version (ported from original version),
which is maintained by independent developer.
This version is currently in beta stage, some features are not yet implemented.

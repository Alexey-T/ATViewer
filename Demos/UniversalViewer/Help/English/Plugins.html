<h3>
  Plugins usage
</h3>
<hr>

<!--------------------------------->
<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>
To install a plugin from <i>.zip</i> / <i>.rar</i> archive, do the following:
<ul>
<li> In UV open "Options -- Configure plugins" dialog, press "Add...",
     select "Add plugin(s) from archive(s)" and press "..." button.
<li> In the Open dialog browse for the archive file (or several files).
</ul>

Or, if plugin archive contains <i>"pluginst.inf"</i> file:
<ul>
<li> Just open this archive in UV. Auto-install prompt will appear.
</ul>

Note: if you install newer plugin version, from the archive with different name,
this may not overwrite the older plugin record. So, you will need to manually delete the older plugin record.

<!--------------------------------->
<h4>Configuring</h4>

<p>
You can tweak plugins a little, this is optional of course,
but may be needed with some plugins which have poor default configuration.
For example, <i>ICLView</i> plugin has the poor configuration, which doesn't contain
<i>.DLL</i> extension.
In "Configure plugins" dialog press "Configure...",
there you can edit plugin <i>detect-string</i>.

<p>
The <i>"detect-string"</i> specifies which filetypes will be opened in plugin by default.
The empty string means that plugin should detect filetypes by content
(must be supported by plugin).
String may contain the following:

<ul>
<li> List of file extensions in the form:<br>
  <i>EXT="TXT" | EXT="DOC" | EXT="RTF"</i>
<li> <i>"FORCE"</i> special word, which can be present with or without extensions:<br>
  <i>EXT="TXT" | FORCE</i> <br>
  This word tells that plugin should be opened also for unknown filetypes,
  when you forcefully call Plugins view ("7" key).
<li> List of file extensions in the form:<br>
  <i>EXT:TXT,DOC,RTF</i> <br>
  <i>EXT:TXT FORCE</i> <br>
  The <i>"FORCE"</i> special word can be present, after space, at the end of line.
</ul>

<!--------------------------------->
<h4>Usage</h4>

<ul>
<li> When Plugins view is active, you can press "7" key repeatedly
to switch between plugins applicable to the current file.
<li> You can see, which plugin is currently active, in the app window caption:
plugin name is written there in brackets.
</ul>

Demo notes:

1. To compile this demo, you'll need additional components:

VirtualShellTools: http://mustangpeak.net
VirtualTreeview: http://www.soft-gems.net
ThemeManager (for Delphi 5-6): http://www.soft-gems.net


2. Use included AT*.inc files, which can save about 240-400 Kb
of final exe size. Place these files into component's Source
folder, over default ones.
